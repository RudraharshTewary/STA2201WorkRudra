```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Lab 1

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
dm <- read_table("https://www.prdh.umontreal.ca/BDLC/data/ont/Mx_1x1.txt", skip = 2, col_types = "dcddd")
dm
```
### 1)

So, we need to plot the male to female mortality rates for ages of 10,20,30 and 40, we do it through the following code Block :-
```{r}
d_to_plot <- dm |> 
  filter(Age %in% c(10,20,30,40)) |> 
  select(Year:Male) |>
  mutate(Mortality_Ratio = Female/Male) |>
  pivot_longer(Female:Male, names_to = "Sex", values_to = "Mortality")
d_to_plot
```
Now, we get the following plot 
```{r}
d_to_plot |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Mortality_Ratio, color = as.factor(Age))) + 
  geom_line() + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```

### 2)
We can find the age with the lowest mortality rate through the following code :-
```{r}
lowest_mortality_age <- dm|>
  group_by(Year)|>
  arrange(Female)|>
  slice(1) |>
  select(Year, Age, Female)
lowest_mortality_age
```

### 3)
We can find the standard deviation through the following code :-
```{r}
dm$Age <- as.numeric(dm$Age)
std_dev <- dm |>
  group_by(Age) |>
  summarise(across(2:4,sd,na.rm=TRUE))
std_dev
```
### 4)
We get our new table as :-
```{r}

dl <- read_table("https://www.prdh.umontreal.ca/BDLC/data/ont/Population.txt", skip = 1, col_types = "dcddd")
dm$Age<- as.character(dm$Age)
total<-left_join(dm,dl, by = c("Year","Age"))|>
  group_by(Year) |>
  drop_na() |>
  summarize(Avg_Male_Mortality = weighted.mean(Male.x, w=Male.y, na.rm = TRUE),
            Avg_Female_Mortality = weighted.mean(Female.x, w=Female.y, na.rm = TRUE))
total

total |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Year)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Avg_Male_Mortality, color = "Male")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Avg_Female_Mortality, color = "Female")) +
  labs(title = "Population Weighted Average Mortality Rate",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Weighted Mortality Rate") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Male" = "blue", "Female" = "pink")) +
  theme_minimal()
```
When we look at the plot, we see that the Weighted Male mortality rate was higher than the female mortality rate between the years of 1925 to 2000 because of multiple reasons, some deaths being caused due to males doing more risky/unsafe jobs which could have worker casualties and, a big contributor to male deaths would also be the world wars, where 66,000 canadians lost their lives in World War 1 and over 45,000 canadians died in World War 2.
### 5)

We will run the linear regression using the following code snippet
```{r}
dm$Age <- as.numeric(dm$Age)
lm_table <- dm |>
  filter(Age < 106,Year==2000) |>
  select(Female,Age)
lm_table
model <- lm(log(Female) ~ Age, data = lm_table)
summary(model)
```
Here, we have a regression coefficient of 0.086891 for age. Noting the fact that the female mortality rate in our model is logged, this implies that keeping everything else constant, for every 1 unit increase in Age of a female, we would see an 8.6891% increase in the mortality rate.
